## General info
### What is the project about and why was it made?
This project was made to showcase the use of API on a website with the use of standard HTML and CSS and minimal JS. The site allows football supporters from any league or most specifically Ligue 2 to view the latest news from last season 2019/20 to the new season 2020/21. The site will display certain data to users such as; latest Ligue 2 news, standings, fixtures and results and clubs. I made this site to show that I can create a site using API. The data extracted was from a site called APIFootball.com.

### What did I learn making this project?
I learnt that using <’pre’> var_dump(), would list out the array instead of the array being bunched up and cluttered. This function was useful and made the process of picking out information very quick. I needed to use this function when I had issues displaying the line-ups how I wanted to and therefore had to dump all the contents on the page. From there I  picked out the player names within the line-ups of both teams and recorded them myself in the line-ups section.
