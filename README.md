## General info
### What is the project about and why was it made?
This project was made to showcase the use of API on a website with the use of standard HTML and CSS and minimal JS. The site allows football supporters from any league or most specifically Ligue 2 to view the latest news from last season 2019/20 to the new season 2020/21. The site will display certain data to users such as; latest Ligue 2 news, standings, fixtures and results and clubs. I made this site to show that I can create a site using API. The data extracted was from a site called APIFootball.com.

### What did I learn making this project?
I learnt that using <’pre’> var_dump(), would list out the array instead of the array being bunched up and cluttered. This function was useful and made the process of picking out information very quick. I needed to use this function when I had issues displaying the line-ups how I wanted to and therefore had to dump all the contents on the page. From there I  picked out the player names within the line-ups of both teams and recorded them myself in the line-ups section.

## Setup
### Use of local server or libraries in project?
For this project I used localhost server so that I could use and amend the site. The local server program that I used for this project was Xampp.

### Instructions on how to access and open the doc for localhost?
Below is a guide that shows how to open the project.
*	First a localhost server is needed.
*	Get the server working.
*	Download the project via zip file, this can be located under the code dropdown that is highlighted green.
*	When the zip file is downloaded go to the file and extract the docs.
* Extract the docs into the localhost directory file. This file should be the one that allows the downloaded files to be read and be displayed on the local server thus showing the full site. i.e.- For xampp (local server program) the directory file would be htdocs.

### Instructions when on site
*	On the fixtures and results page, the matchday dropdown will show 38 links but none work as they are there for aesthetics and I wanted to only focus on one matchday schedule.
*	On the fixtures and results page go to the Le Mans v Lens game as the other matches don’t have any hyperlinks and will lead to error page.

## Status
### Is the project finished, does it need time to finish, what is the current progress?
The project is finished but may be amended in the future.
* Currently looking to make the images within the project pages bigger when user clicks onto them for a better view.

## Inspiration
### What inspired you to create a certain design or structure of the site?
What inspired me when designing and creating my site was other football league websites. Bundesliga.com, EFL Championship.co.uk and LaLiga.com are sites that helped a lot with how I would layout certain pages and most importantly what information to display to the user.  
There are certain parts of the site that I needed to have help with both were header tabs and table row hyperlink.
*	Heading tab

I wanted to use this tab heading style as its unique and isn’t used on any of the popular football sites. I used this because the tabs neatly sort out both the home and away team line-ups which also include the manager and substitutes. 

*	Hyperlink table rows

When creating the fixtures rows, I needed to add hyperlinks to all the matches so that the user can be taken the match page to see all the information from the selected match. With the current site I have only applied this to one match but in the future, I may need to apply the hyperlink to all matches therefore I needed to use the method shown in the link.
